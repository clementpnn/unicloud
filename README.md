# Terraform & Ansible GCP Project

This project utilizes **Terraform** to deploy an EC2 instance on AWS, followed by **Ansible** to configure the instance by installing Docker using the ```geerlingguy.docker``` Ansible role. A **Makefile** is included to simplify common Terraform commands.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Terraform
Terraform must be installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official site: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### 2. Install AWS CLI
The AWS CLI simplifies the configuration of your AWS credentials. Download and install it from the official site: [AWS CLI Downloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

### 3. Configure GCP credentials
You need to configure your GCP credentials so that Terraform can interact with GCP. Run the following command to set up your credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

### 4. Install Ansible
Ansible is required to configure the EC2 instance after it's created. You can download and install it from the official site: [Ansible Downloads](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

### 5. Install the Ansible role geerlingguy.docker
This project uses the Ansible role ```geerlingguy.docker``` to install Docker on the EC2 instance. You need to install this role before running Ansible.

Install the role with the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.docker
```

### 6. Clone the project
Clone this repository to get started with the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clementpnn/unicloud.git
cd unicloud
```

### 7. Create a secrets.tfvars file
Create a secrets.tfvars file in the infrastructure directory with the following variables:

```bash
ssh_public_key = ""

adiarra_email   = ""
avisage_email   = ""
mdesruets_email = ""

db_user     = ""
db_password = ""
db_name     = ""


```

### Key files:
```terraform/```: Contains Terraform configuration files to create the GCP instance.
```ansible/playbook.yml```: Ansible playbook to install Docker on the GCP instance.
```Makefile```: Simplifies the execution of common Terraform commands.

## Makefile Usage
The **Makefile** includes several commands to facilitate working with Terraform. Below is a summary of the available commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```make all```| Initializes Terraform and applies the configuration (creates infrastructure). |
| ```make init```| Initializes the Terraform directory (downloads plugins, configures the backend). |
|```make apply```| Applies the Terraform plan and deploys the infrastructure. |
|```make destroy```| Destroys all resources managed by Terraform. |
|```make clean```| Removes locally generated Terraform files, such as state files (```.tfstate```). |

### 1. Initialize Terraform
Before you can apply or destroy infrastructure, you need to initialize Terraform to download necessary modules and plugins.

Run this command:

```bash
make init
```

### 2. Apply Terraform configuration
To create the infrastructure defined in your Terraform files (e.g., an EC2 instance), run:

```bash
make apply
```

This command automatically applies the Terraform plan and creates all specified resources without prompting for confirmation, thanks to the ```-auto-approve option```.

### 3. Destroy the infrastructure
To destroy all resources created by Terraform, run:

```bash
make destroy
```

This will remove all AWS resources associated with this configuration, such as the EC2 instance.

### 4. Clean up Terraform-generated files
If you want to clean up the state files generated by Terraform locally, run the ```clean``` command:

```bash
make clean
```

This command removes the ```terraform.tfstate```, ```terraform.tfstate.backup```, and ```.terraform directory``` where temporary files are stored.

## Connecting to the Server from Your Terminal
To connect to the EC2 server from your terminal, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the **private SSH key** that matches the public key used when creating the EC2 instance.
2. Identify the **public IP address** of your EC2 instance. You can obtain this from the Terraform output or the AWS console.
3. Use the following SSH command to connect to the server:

```bash
ssh -i "~/.ssh/id_rsa" admin@<public_ip>
```

- ```-i "~/.ssh/id_rsa"```: This specifies the path to the private key (```id_rsa```). Adjust the path if your private key is stored elsewhere.
- ```admin@<public_ip>```: This specifies the user (```admin``` for Debian-based images, adjust if you're using a different distribution) and the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

Once connected, you can run any commands on the server, including verifying Docker installation.

---

If you get an error message like ```Permission denied (publickey).```, you need to change the permissions of the private key file:

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
